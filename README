CFTP - a simple in-band file transfer application protocol experiment
Andrew Coleman
CSC-4200

To compile:
  gcc -o cftp -Wall server.c client.c cftp.c

For explanation on running:
  ./cftp -h

There is only one binary, with a switch for the server. All other options are
common and will work for either server or client.

Multi-client capable. Not necessarily single user.
